NUMBER GAME
This Java program is a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). The user is prompted to guess the number, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. This process repeats until the user guesses the correct number.

1. Generate Random Number: The program generates a random number within the specified range.
2. Prompt User for Guess: The program prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare Guess: The program compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback:
If the guess is correct, the user is congratulated, and the game ends.
If the guess is too high, the program informs the user that the guess is too high.
If the guess is too low, the program informs the user that the guess is too low.
4. Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the user guesses the correct number.
